At the assigment it said to create this file to explain what i did so here it goes: 

Recursive Fibonacci: started fast but slowed exponentially. stopped at n =47 taking over 10 seconds because of repeated calculations.

Iterative Fibonacci: All values computed instantly even at n=50 because it uses a simple loop with no repeated work.

Recursive InsertLast: Stack overflow occurred immediately on 50,000-node list before timing could complete

Iterative InsertLast: Took ~0.04 ms with constant stack depth of 1, safe and efficient for any list size.
